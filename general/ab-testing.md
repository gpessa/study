## AB testing

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.
Testing takes the guesswork out of website optimization and enables data-informed decisions that shift business conversations from "we think" to "we know." By measuring the impact that changes have on your metrics, you can ensure that every change produces positive results.

In order to have good AB testing good principles are:

- Provide data to the employees and listen to their hypothesis
- Organize your workforce in small multidisciplinary teams that works on a small portion of the website so they can be expert on that matter and run small tests on those areas
- Limit the risk and keep tests smalls so you can understand better what works and what no without rumors due to other tests that might lead to wrong conclusions

Definitions:
- *Control treatment*: is the actual situation
- *Variant treatment*: is the hypothesis we are trying to understand if could works more
- *Significant*: chance the result of a statistic is real and you reduce the false positive
