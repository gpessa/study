## AB testing

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.
Testing takes the guesswork out of website optimization and enables data-informed decisions that shift business conversations from "we think" to "we know." By measuring the impact that changes have on your metrics, you can ensure that every change produces positive results.

In order to have good AB testing good principles are:

- Provide data to the employees and listen to their hypothesis
- Organize your workforce in small multidisciplinary teams that works on a small portion of the website so they can be expert on that matter and run small tests on those areas
- Limit the risk and keep tests smalls so you can understand better what works and what no without rumors due to other tests that might lead to wrong conclusions

Definitions:
- *Control treatment*: is the actual situation
- *Variant treatment*: is the hypothesis we are trying to understand if could works more
- *Significant*: chance the result of a statistic is real and you reduce the false positive. In order to increase it you have to increase the sample size

A problem is to understand when you stop a test, when the test has significant meaning and data can be read.

A/B tests are made to know what user subconsciously wants. It help to fail fast and learn from those mistakes.

Usually in order to understand the behaviour is good to add multiple matrics to graps the complexity of the human behaviour.

Avoid overlapping of tests.

Conversion is usually one of the most important metrics but others are pretty important too:
- *Acquisition*: How did you acquire the visit to your site? Some examples of an acquisition source would be organic search, paid search, referral visit, and social visit.
- *Abandonment rate*: This is a term used heavily with e-commerce sites and applies when a user starts a checkout process but then leaves before completion. This metric is a measurement of how often a user “abandons” the checkout procedure before the transaction (or hotel booking) was completed.
- *Acquisition cost (or CPA / PPA)*: This is how much it cost to acquire the customer on your website or another digital channel. If you’re carrying out paid advertising with Google for your hotel, then your acquisition cost (CPA) will be the total spend divided by the number of bookings resulting from the campaign.
- *Assisted conversion*: Another metric used heavily within the Google Analytics tracking platform, an assisted conversion is when one visitor source helped another when it comes to a booking. For example, say a customer first visited your hotel website from a paid search ad on Google. They don’t complete a booking at your hotel during that visit, but they remember your website address and return to the site a week later by typing in the URL directly (a direct visit). If they complete a booking from the 2nd visit, then the original paid search visit is attributed with the “assist,” or an assisted conversion.
- *Average session duration*: This is the average length of time that a user spends on your hotel website. This metric can show how your customers are interacting with your website content. Generally speaking, the longer the time the better, as your visitor is more engaged with your content.
- *Bounce rate*: A very common metric, a “bounce” is simply when a user visits your hotel website and almost immediately leaves the site without any interaction. A high bounce rate (70% and above typically) can be a sign of a badly designed web page, or one with content that doesn’t satisfy what the user is looking for.
- *Click-through rate (CTR)*: This is a term often used with paid search advertising, and determines how many clicks an element received as a percentage value. So if your advert got just one click from 100 impressions, it has a CTR of 1%. This metric is really important in paid search but is also used with organic search and other channels.
- *Conversion*: A conversion is a metric that allows you to mark any event which is of significant importance. Conversion tracking in Google Analytics must be manually set up. An example of a conversion for a hotel website would be a room booking confirmation. The actual page URL (often needed as part of the conversion definition) would likely be the checkout confirmation page.
- *Conversion rate*: This is the rate of conversions on your website. Another key metric, this one allows you to see how many conversions you’re getting based on your number of website visits. If you get 10 reservations from 100 visits, you’ve got an excellent conversion rate of 10%. Realistically we see conversion rates between 2-3% in many hotel websites.
- *Cost per click (CPC)*: Used heavily within the paid search advertising industry, this is a measurement of the cost of every ad click. The CPC will depend on a number of factors, such as the relevancy of your website compared to the keyword you’re targeting. If you bid on your competitors’ hotel names, for example, then you’ll likely be penalized with a very high CPC. Generally, for a standard hotel in the U.S. the typical CPC could be between $1 and $4 for branded search, and a lot more for non-brand search.
- *Drop-off*: Often used as part of a funnel (see definition), a drop-off is simply when a website visitor leaves the website. It could be for a perfectly normal reason, but “drop-offs” usually occur as part of a checkout process, so you want to avoid these.
- *Funnel*: Within Google Analytics the funnel is a feature that allows you to enter the key pages involved with completing a booking on your hotel website. First step may be visiting the homepage, second step may be viewing the rooms page, third step may be entering the booking page, all the way through to the confirmation page. When set up, this allows you to visually see when (and how often) users are leaving, or completing, their reservation.
- *New users*: This is a measure of the number of users that have visited your website. It’s important to note that if a user returns from another device (mobile or tablet, for example) they’ll be counted as a new user.
- *Return on investment (ROI)*: Same as its traditional definition, ROI is a measure of returns on expenditures. For example, a hotel that spends $1,000 on a Google AdWords campaign that generates $5,000 in reservations got a campaign ROI of 5:1, or 500%.
- *Unique visitor or User*: This term describes individual visitors to your website. Within Google Analytics you often see a figure for total number of Users (individuals), and total Sessions (the total visits made by these individual users).
