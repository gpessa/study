## box-sizing: border-box;

The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

`width + padding + border = actual width of an element`

`height + padding + border = actual height of an element`

This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).
